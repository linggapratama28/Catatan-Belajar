    "### Exercises\n",
    "You recently started working as a data scientist at a company named Communicatb. For your first project, you and your team need to analyze churn customer data for a cell phone company. The goal is to predict their behavior and help develop a program to retain customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your team lead knows you are an expert on storytelling. She asks you to explain to the team why crafting a compelling story is important when delivering results. You write down a list of reasons to be prepared.\n",

    "One of the statements you wrote is false. Can you select which one is it?\n",

    "- A. It will be easier for the audience to remember an anecdote on why customers churn than the correlation coefficients between customer traits.\n",
    "- B. Your findings will be better aligned with change-adverse stakeholder expectations. They will be most likely to implement the program to retain customers.\n",
    "- C. Even if your data do not reveal a distinct customer behavior, storytelling might influence stakeholders to create the retention program.\n",

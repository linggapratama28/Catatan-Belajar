    "### Exercise\n",
    "The appearance of a histogram is heavily influenced by the width of its bins: the intervals that determine where each bar lies on the x-axis. If the bins are too wide, you don't see enough detail in the shape of the distribution. If the bins are too narrow, the distribution can be obscured by noise. It's very difficult to know the \"best\" binwidth, until you physically look at the plot: draw lots of histograms with a range of binwidths until you find one that helps you answer the question.\n",

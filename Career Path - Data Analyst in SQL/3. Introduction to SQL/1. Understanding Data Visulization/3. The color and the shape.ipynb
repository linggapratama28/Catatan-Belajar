    "# 1. Another dimension for scatter plots\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "If you have a scatter plot, but want to distinguish the points in some way based on another variable, then you have a few options. As discussed in the video, 3D plots are usually dreadful on a 2D screen, but there are other options to stick to x-y axes and still visualize the third dimension. You can change the color, size, transparency or shape of the points, or split the plot into multiple panels.\n",

    "- A. Using different sizes or transparencies makes it hard to distinguish points that overlap.\n",
    "- B. Using separate panels provides the best way to distinguish points from each city, but makes it harder to see if there is a single trend across the whole dataset.\n",
    "- C. Using different shapes provides the best way to distinguish points from each city, but makes it harder to see if there is a single trend across the whole dataset.\n",

    "### Exercise\n",
    "As with points in a scatter plot, you may often want to be able to distinguish several lines in a line plot. Like points, you can change the colors or transparency level, or use multiple panels. The two differences to points are that you can change line widths rather than point sizes, and you can change linetype (solid, dashes, or dots) rather than point shape.\n",
